Solutions for LeetCode problems.

<!-- more -->

## Story

Recently, I've practiced to solve LeetCode problems.

I created this project to keep notes for LeetCode problems.

## Versions

- Version 1: At this moment, I changed the v1 version repository to private repository.
- Version 2:

  This version is rewritten from the scratch based on v1 code base since v1 used Astro v1.

  **Features**
    - Astro v2.
    - SEO.
    - Analytics Integrations: Google Analytics, Swetrix Analytics, Counter Analytics.
    - Re-implemented multiple theme using [TailwindCSS Themer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwindcss-themer).
    - Improved UI design.

  **Developer Features**
    - Use my own [Astro starter template](https://github.com/ansidev/astro-basic-template) with multiple pre-configurations to help saving the development time.

  **Release notes**: [v2.0.0](https://github.com/ansidev/leetcode-blog/releases/tag/v2.0.0).
